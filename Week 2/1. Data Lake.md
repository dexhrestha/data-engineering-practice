## Data Lake ?
    (Raw data)
- central repository that holds big data from many sources
- ingest data ASAP and make it available for others (analytics/processing)
- should be able to scale with inexpensive hardware
- generally unsrtuctured
- used for applications ML,Stream analytics,AI
Examples : GCP cloud storage/AWS S3

## Data Warehouse ?
    (Refined data)
- Highly structure and clean
- Must be processed before ingestion 
- Periodic purging
- Historic data from transaction systems,operations


## Need of Data Lake?

- Store and access data quickly
- Usefulness of data can be in later stages of project lifecycle
- R&D in data products using data lake
- need for cheap storage of big data

## ETL vs ELT

Export Transform Load vs Export Load Transform
ETL = > small data (Data Warehouse)
ELT = > large data (Data Lake)
ELT based on schema on read

## Problems:
- Can turn to data swamp and become useless
- Requires data versioning
- No metadata associated
