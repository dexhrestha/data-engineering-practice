# Data Engineering Practice

This is a repo to track my learning of Data Engineering Zoomcamp organized by DataTalksClub.  
The videos for learning are avaiable on [DataTalksClub](https://github.com/dexhrestha/data-engineering-practice/blob/main/Week%201/notebooks/Homework%20Week%201.ipynb) channel.

I will update what I learned through this course everyday in this repo.   
And, hopefully try to document and explain what I learned so that I can refer it in the future.

Cheers!!
