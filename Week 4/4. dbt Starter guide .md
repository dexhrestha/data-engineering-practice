# Create new dbt project

dbt provides an starter project with all the basic folders and files

There are two ways to do this:

1. With the CLI
 - After installing dbt locally, setup the `profiles.yml` and run `dbt init` in the path you want to start the project. This will clone the starter project in your desired path.

2. With dbt Cloud
 - After setting up the db cloud credentials we can start the project form `web-based IDE`
